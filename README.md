## How I made this project
- I first made this project using Scratch. 
- In scratch, I used Forever loops, if statements and other conditional statements.
- The most used functions was Sprite, via which i was able to make the interface interactive.
- I used various templates offered in Scratch to build the interface and backgrounds too.
- Later,  with the help of Leopard.js, I was able to convert my Scratch code to Java Script code.
